# project name
**AirBnB_clone**

# project description 
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: 
       *the AirBnB clone.
        *This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects:
                                *HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:
         *put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
         *create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
         *create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
         *create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
         *create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
